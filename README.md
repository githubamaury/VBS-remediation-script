Many Windows components can trigger VBS activation. This script checks and disables them. This can be useful if you want to run ESX in Vmware Workstation Pro for lab use. 
Please let me know of any issues. 
I don't take any credit for it since it was mostly AI generated, but one still has to check all possible VBS triggers in Windows, remediate any errors the AI makes, optimize the script and test run on multiple machines. It automatically creates a restore point to solve system issues if any would appear.
